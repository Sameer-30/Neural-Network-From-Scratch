# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository documents my journey in building a neural network entirely from scratch using Python. The project includes detailed notes, explanations, and code examples that walk through core concepts and implementation steps, all formatted in Markdown and optimized for Google Colab.

## What I've Done

- **Single Neuron Implementation:**
  - Developed a single neuron using pure Python.
  - Demonstrated how to compute the weighted sum of inputs, add a bias, and produce an output.
  - Provided mathematical explanations using LaTeX.

- **Layer of Neurons:**
  - Built a layer of neurons where each neuron receives the same input vector but has its own set of weights and bias.
  - Illustrated the use of loops to compute outputs for each neuron in the layer.

- **Efficient Computation with NumPy:**
  - Re-implemented the neural network layer using NumPy for vectorized operations.
  - Explained and used dot products and matrix multiplication to compute neuron outputs efficiently.
  - Covered transposition and bias addition for handling batches of data.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  - Created detailed notes in Markdown with LaTeX-rendered mathematical expressions.
  - Included code snippets that are ready to be copied and pasted into Google Colab.
  - Structured the project with clear sections for understanding both the theory and practical implementation.
